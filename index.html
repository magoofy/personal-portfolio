        <p>
            Hello! My name is Siosaia Akau, but I go by Afi (off-ee). I was born and raised in West Point, Utah, where I spent the first 19
            years of my life. I attended Syracuse High while also attending Weber State University, and by the end of my high school 
            career, I recieved my associates degree. I was also a barista for 1.5 years at a coffee house called, Beans & Brews, which 
            sparked my love for coffee. Now, I attend the University of Southern California where I am getting my bacherlors in 
            Business Administration. My hobbies include skateboarding, listening to music, and gaming. I am trying to learn to cook
            (ever so slowly) and code at Berkley's Bootcamp!

            <h3>PARK BUDDY</h3>
            <p>
                Park Buddy was my first major project at my Berkley Bootcamp! I worked on a team to create a project that utilized html,
                css, bootstrap, API's, and javascript. The website allows the user to search up any state, by state code, and gives 
                information about all state parks including an interactive map!

            <h3>Homegrown</h3>
            <p>Homegrown was my second webiste that we built as a team for my Berkley Bootcamp. This was the most in-depth project I have worked on
                so far. We set up a server, made our own database, routes, apis, used node, and much more!
